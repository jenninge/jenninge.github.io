## About Me

My name is Elissa. I have been in the healthcare field for 10 years and I currently work as an MRI Technologist. I am currently completing my bachelorâ€™s in computer science. My goal is to use this degree in the data analytics field. I have a passion for discovering what data is trying to tell us and using that information to improve work processes in various industries.

## Code Review

## Projects

###Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

The artifact for this enhancement is from the introduction to C++ programming language course. The original project demonstrated how to read an input file, place contents into a map, and place the read contents into an output file. This program used a simple txt file to read.
I chose to enhance the project by reading an input file into a vector and performing CRUD operations on it. The operations I created include reading all data, reading a specific piece of data, updating data, and deleting data. The program can be easily adjusted based on the type of input file. The end goal is to transform the data before loading it either into another file or a database.
