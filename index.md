# Elissa Jennings Portfolio

## About Me

My name is Elissa. I have been in the healthcare field for 10 years and I currently work as an MRI Technologist. I am currently completing my bachelorâ€™s in computer science. My goal is to use this degree in the data analytics field. I have a passion for discovering what data is trying to tell us and using that information to improve work processes in various industries.

## Code Review

This code review provides the plans for all three enhancements. This includes increased functionality and better code comments.

## Projects

### Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

The artifact for this enhancement is from the introduction to C++ programming language course. The original project demonstrated how to read an input file, place contents into a map, and place the read contents into an output file. This program used a simple txt file to read.  All programming was completed using Visual Studios IDE.

I chose to enhance the project by reading an input file into a vector and performing CRUD operations on it. The operations I created include reading all data, reading a specific piece of data, updating data, and deleting data. The program can be easily adjusted based on the type of input file. The end goal is to transform the data before loading it either into another file or a database.

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact for this enhancement is from the software testing and automation class. It was created using Java programming language. The original program was used for JUNIT testing only. It had no functionality for a java application. The program created arrays of contact and appointment data and tested various functions. The functions included adding, updating, and deleting contacts and appointments. All programming was completed using Eclipse IDE.   

Enhancement to this program includes full functionality as a java application. Instead of an array for appointments, I used a linked list. I chose a linked list because an appointment list would constantly be changing, and a linked list is better for frequent insertions and deletions. Instead of an array for contacts, I implemented a hashmap. A hashmap is better for contacts because a contact list can become very large and dynamically changing and a hashmap is better container for that.   

#### Time Complexities
| Container | Best | Worst |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Array | O(1) | O(1)/O(n) |
| Linked List | O(1) | O(n) |
| HashMap | O(1) | O(n) |

### Enhancement Three: Databases

The artifact for this enhancement is also from the introduction to C++ programming language course. The original project demonstrated how to read an input file, place contents into a map, and place the read contents into an output file. This program used a simple txt file to read.  All programming was completed using Visual Studios IDE.

The enhancement to this project includes connecting to a SQLite database. I wanted to make enhancements so the program could read any file type, insert the data into a vector, and then insert the data into the SQLite database to perform CRUD operations. This program has many functions. These functions include reading a file, opening the database, creating a table, adding/reading/updating/deleting data.
