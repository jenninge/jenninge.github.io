## Self-Assessment

My journey through the computer science program has been eye-opening. I currently have experience working in healthcare as an MRI Technologist. I felt I reached my potential in my current career and needed to challenge myself in a new field. I have learned so much throughout the program. I learned how to program in different programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java. I also learned the importance of communication, documentation, and teamwork to succeed with a project. I also learned the valuable lesson of asking for help when I had trouble getting code to work or understanding different concepts.   

This degree has opened my eyes to many different career fields. My dream career would be in data science. I enjoy working with data to solve larger problems. I gained experience in SQL, MongoDB, Power BI, and Excel. I learned the importance of data quality, ETL processes, gap analysis, and cleaning the data so it is usable. Ideally, I would like to use my experience in healthcare and apply it to data science to improve healthcare and patient outcomes.   

Below are some projects to demonstrate my skills in various programming languages and data structures.

## Projects

### Deep Q-Learning Project  

This project utilized deep Q-Learning to solve a maze. The goal of the program is to solve the maze in the shortest amount of moves with a 100%-win rate. Most of the program was provided for me and my job was to create a deep Q-learning portion to train the AI agent. I utilized various machine learning concepts. The main concept utilized was reinforcement learning. This utilizes states, actions, and rewards to help guide the AI agent. Exploitation/exploration was used to instruct the AI agent on how to proceed. Ideally the agent would exploit more rather than explore to solve the maze faster.

### Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design   

The artifact for this enhancement is from CS210, an introduction to C++ programming language course. The original project demonstrated how to read an input file, count the occurrence of each item and place them into an output file. It was created in the fall of 2023. All programming was completed using Visual Studios IDE. I chose this program because it had a good base for functionality. My goal was to enhance the program to be able to perform CRUD operations on the data from the input file so it could eventually be loaded into some type of database.

I enhanced the project by reading an input file into a vector and performing CRUD operations on the vector. The operations I created included reading all data, reading a specific piece of data, updating data, and deleting data. The program can be easily adjusted based on the type of input file. The enhancement demonstrates my skills with data transformation, data structures, and well-defined functions.

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact for this enhancement is from CS320, software testing and automation class. It was created in April 2024 using Java programming language. All programming was completed using Eclipse IDE. The original program was used for JUNIT testing only. It had no functionality for a java application. The program created arrays of contact and appointment data and tested various functions. The functions included adding, updating, and deleting contacts and appointments. I chose this program because it had a good base code to add functionality to run it as a java application. I wanted to demonstrate my skills with different data structures, ability to add functionality, and demonstrate my understanding of time complexity.   

Enhancement to this program includes full functionality as a java application. The array of appointments was changed to a linked list. I chose a linked list because an appointment list would constantly be changing, and a linked list is better for frequent insertions and deletions. The array of contacts was changed to a HashMap. A HashMap is better for large and dynamically changing data like contact information.   

This enhancement solidified the importance of classes. This program became very large, very quickly and without the use of classes it would be unmanageable. I ran into issues when trying to print the data from the containers but was unable to solve it. This enhancement most likely would have been easier programming it as a Python script. If I was unable to get a function working properly, I left detailed notes so anyone could see what my process was. I feel this program has improved drastically since it had zero functionality to it in the beginning.    


#### Time Complexities    

| Container | Best | Worst |   

| :----: | :----: | :----: |   
| Array | O(1) | O(1)/O(n) |   
| Linked List | O(1) | O(n) |   
| HashMap | O(1) | O(n) |

### Enhancement Three: Databases

The artifact for this enhancement is the same project from the first enhancement. It is from CS210, an introduction to C++ programming language course. The original project demonstrated how to read an input file, count the occurrence of each item and place them into an output file. It was created in the fall of 2023. All programming was completed using Visual Studios IDE. I chose this program because it had a good base for functionality. My goal was to enhance the program to read any type of file and place the data into a SQLite database for queries. I wanted to showcase my skills working with relational databases and querying the data.  

The enhancement to this project includes connecting to a SQLite database. I wanted to make enhancements so the program could read any file type, insert the data into a vector, and then insert the data into the SQLite database to perform CRUD operations. This program has many functions. These functions include reading a file, opening the database, creating a table, and adding/reading/updating/deleting data. The improvements make it much easier to deal with large amounts of data and being able to reference at any time by connecting to the database.    

Through this enhancement, I have learned that well thought-out plans may not go as expected. I was unable to get the data from the CSV file inserted into the database. Although I was unable to solve this problem, I inserted detailed comments to demonstrate what I have tried and what my process was. Bulk inserts can be challenging when working with a SQL database. The enhanced artifact has more real-world applications than the original program.
